This is the frontend for the task management system built with Angular. It allows users to manage tasks by interacting with the backend API.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed before proceeding:

- **Node.js v20.18.0** You can find here: [Node.js v20.18.0]( https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager).

You can verify your Node.js version with the following command:

```sh
node -v
```

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/angular-task-app.git
```
Navigate to the project directory:
```sh
cd angular-task-app
```
Install the required dependencies:
```sh
npm install
```

## Configure the backend:

After setting up the frontend, you need to clone and run the backend for the application. You can find the backend repository here:
